                <p><strong>Titan Collection and Credit Management Inc. (Titan CCMI)</strong> began as the collection division of the <strong>Asialink Group of Companies (AGC)</strong>, initially serving the Western Visayas region. For many years, we operated as AGC's trusted collection arm, developing deep expertise in debt recovery and credit management.</p>
                
                <p>As the demand for specialized and ethical credit solutions grew, <strong>Titan CCMI</strong> was established as an independent corporation to provide efficient and reliable services to a wider market. From its beginnings as a regional operation, Titan has evolved into a <strong>nationwide provider</strong>, serving numerous <strong>banks and financing</strong> institutions across the country.</p>
                
                <p>Under the leadership of <strong>Chairman Jojo S. Montes</strong>, Titan continues to strengthen its position in the industry with a focus on innovation, operational excellence, and long-term strategic vision. His guidance has been instrumental in expanding the company's reach and enhancing its services to meet the changing needs of clients.</p>
                
                <p>At Titan, we understand that <strong>strong financial management</strong> is vital to business success. Our services go beyond debt recovery, aiming to foster growth and financial stability for businesses navigating an increasingly complex economic environment.</p>
